# Obsidian Ollama Plugin (Enhanced for Chinese & Qwen3:8B)

This project is a modified version of the original [Obsidian Ollama Plugin](https://github.com/your-original-plugin-repo-link), aimed at providing better support for the Chinese language and optimized integration for the Qwen3:8B model.

## ‚ú® Project Overview

The original Obsidian Ollama Plugin is a fantastic tool that lets users interact directly with a locally running Ollama service within the Obsidian note-taking software. However, during use, it was found that its support for **Chinese Prompts** wasn't ideal, and for newer models like **Tongyi Qianwen Qwen3:8B**, the output format could be inconvenient, sometimes including internal thinking processes.

This modified version tackles these issues! It specifically strengthens **native Chinese Prompt support** and adds a "filter" for the Qwen3:8B output, by default removing the model's internal thinking process (like `` or similar markers). This results in cleaner output, making it more suitable for use in your notes.

**üìå Note:** Before using this plugin, please ensure you have the **Ollama service correctly installed and running** on your local machine, and that you have **downloaded the model you want to use** (e.g., by running `ollama pull qwen:8b`).

## üöÄ Key Features

-   **Seamless Chinese Prompt Handling:** Significantly optimized the plugin's logic for processing Chinese Prompts, ensuring your Chinese input is accurately passed to and understood by the Ollama model.
-   **Optimized Qwen3:8B Support:** Integrated and tested specifically with the Tongyi Qianwen Qwen3:8B model, ensuring stable operation within the plugin.
-   **Cleaner Output Filtering:** Automatically identifies and **by default removes** the internal thinking process often included in the Qwen3:8B model's output, leaving only the essential generated text.

## ‚¨áÔ∏è Installation Guide

Installing this plugin is similar to other third-party Obsidian plugins, but since it's a modified version, you'll need to install it manually:

1.  **Locate your Obsidian Vault path:** This is the main folder where you store all your Obsidian notes.
2.  **Navigate to the `.obsidian` folder:** Inside your vault path, find a **hidden folder** named `.obsidian`. If you can't see it, make sure your operating system settings are configured to show hidden files.
3.  **Navigate to the `plugins` folder:** Inside the `.obsidian` folder, find or create a folder named `plugins`.
4.  **Download and Place Project Files:**
    * **Method A (Recommended - Using Git):** Open your terminal or command prompt inside the `plugins` folder and clone this repository:
        ```bash
        git clone [https://github.com/steppp1/Obsidian-ollama-plugin.git](https://github.com/steppp1/Obsidian-ollama-plugin.git)
        ```
        This will create a subfolder named `Obsidian-ollama-plugin` inside `plugins` and download the project code into it.
    * **Method B (Manual Download & Extract):** Go to this project's GitHub page, click the green "Code" button, and select "Download ZIP". After downloading, extract the ZIP file. You'll get a folder (usually named something like `Obsidian-ollama-plugin-master`). Copy or move this **entire folder** into your vault's `.obsidian/plugins/` directory. For tidiness, it's recommended to rename the folder to `Obsidian-ollama-plugin`.
5.  **Enable the Plugin in Obsidian:**
    * Open your Obsidian app.
    * Go to "**Settings**" -> "**Community plugins**".
    * In the "**Installed plugins**" list, find the plugin named "**Obsidian Ollama Plugin (Enhanced)**" or similar.
    * Click the **toggle switch** next to it to turn it on!

## üí° How to Use

1.  First, **ensure your Ollama service is running** in the background and you **have the required model downloaded** (e.g., `ollama pull qwen:8b`).
2.  After enabling the plugin in Obsidian, its settings should appear in the Obsidian settings menu. Here, you'll likely need to specify the Ollama service address (usually `http://localhost:11434`) and the **name of the model** you want to use by default (e.g., fill in `qwen:8b`).
3.  Then you're ready to go! Based on the plugin's configuration (often triggered via the **command palette** or a **hotkey**), select some text and run an Ollama-related command (like "**Complete text**" or "**Chat**") to have the model generate content for you.

* Ensure you have both `README.md` (English version) and `README.zh-CN.md` (Chinese version) files in your project root directory, and that the links at the top of each file correctly point to the other.
* Remember to choose an open-source license and create the `LICENSE` file!
